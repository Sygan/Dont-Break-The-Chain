Don't Break the Chain Generator
===============================

My fork allows to set monday as first day of the week so not to follow religous stuff. :)

Don't wait until January 1st to start a habit! This generator will start your
calendar on any day of the year, of any year.

If you're not familiar with the Don't-Break-the-Chain, it's a technique for
forming daily habits. Print out a calendar and write at the top the activity
you want to do every day. Every day you do the activity, cross the date off.
See how long you can go without missing a day!

The great thing about committing to a daily habit, is that you don't have to
decide if you feel like doing it or not every day. If you're tired, or
unmotivated for a day, you don't have to wonder if you should or not, the
answer is yes, you should.
